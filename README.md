## Requirements

- Display a paginated list of post titles. The data should be retrieved from the JSONPlaceholder API, and there should be pagination controls to retrieve additional pages of data.
- Each post should be able to toggle a side sliding panel/modal that is populated with the rest of that post's data. You should also include the data of the user related to that post. Make this look & behave however you want, but it should not trigger a full route transition.
- We are not providing a mock for this, you will need to figure out a design that you feel represents the best user experience.
- Do not use a front end framework such as bootstrap, but it's fine to use a utility framework like tailwind or neat.
-The UI should be fairly responsive.
- Write tests that prove your functionality works.
